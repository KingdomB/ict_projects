Add margin bottom to the label with a display block. Or margin top to the input

Or you could transform their parent (the div) into a flex container and set the gap prop

You don’t need to set the height
[8:46 PM]
Very very rarely you should set the height property

Well the best solution that I have been able to find is to add line breaks in-between the label and input like below. If anyone has any css fixes please let me know. Ty. <div>   <label for="emial2" class="email2-label">Confirm Email</label>       <br>       <br>   <input type="email" class="email2-input" id="fname" placeholder="Confirm Email Address" required> </div> (edited)

For this usecase, i usually add: display: grid, and gap: 8px on the div wrapper
